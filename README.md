Password Generator allows you to generate complex passwords within a click!

## The future of Password Generator
Password Generator will evolve next year into a new project: [Passliss](https://github.com/Leo-Corporation/Passliss). When Passliss will be release, the support for Password Generator is going to stop and this repository will no longer be maintained anymore.
